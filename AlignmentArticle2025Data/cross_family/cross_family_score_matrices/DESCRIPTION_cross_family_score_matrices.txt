Contains the score matrices for the cross-family analysis.
The 'michael_sw_nw' file has the Smith-Waterman scores for Michael617 against all the manuscripts in that file, added to the Needleman-Wunsch scores for the other manuscripts. This is because Michael617 is a fragment manuscript, and the Smith-Waterman algorithm found the shared region between Michael617 and every other manuscript in the corpus and compared only that shared region, thus generating a positive score.
